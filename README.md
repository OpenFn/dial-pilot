# dial-pilot

A Mifos, iHRIS, ODK integration in partnership with DIAL

_N.B., commits to `master` will be live on OpenFn.org._

## Notes

1. Tasks 1-3 documented inline.
2. There's a potential task 4, which writes a new version of the ODK form based
   on updates in iHRIS and uploads that new form version to ODK Aggregate. This
   could also be accomplished by sending an updated list of cases, or making
   updates to a lookup table on ODK X, CommCare, or something that's built for
   more two-way communication between the `Digital Registry` and the `Data Collection`
   tool.
